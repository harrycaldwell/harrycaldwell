- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @harrycaldwell
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently going into 1st year University for computer science with cyber security and have done both a Level 2 and level 3 BTEC in information technology, working with hardware is a hobby of mine that I would like to explore more and maybe even do small projects of my own, but cyber security is the part of the industry that I would like to persue.

In terms of coding, I am really inexperienced with little knowledge. For this page, I plan on posting projects from the my college course and adding projects that I will be doing while in University. Im treating this as a portfolio of sorts that allows me to record changes to my programs and let people see how I am fixing my programs and progressing.

Programing languages that I have used:
- C
- python
- Octave
- HTML
- CSS
- SQL
