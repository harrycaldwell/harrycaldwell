- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @harrycaldwell
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently going into 1st year University for computer science with cyber security and have done both a Level 2 and level 3 BTEC in information technology, working with hardware is a hobby of mine that I would like to explore more and maybe even do small projects of my own, but cyber security is the part of the industry that I would like to persue.

In terms of coding, I am really inexperianced with little knowledge, For this page I plan on posting projects from the my college course and adding projects that I will be doing while in University so im treating this as a portfolio of sorts that allows me to record changes to my programs and allow people to see how I am fixing my programs, or even progressing which is also a win for me because it allows me go back over comments and changes that I have made if I need to make changes.

Programing languages that I have used:
C
python
Octave
HTML
CSS
SQL
